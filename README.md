<p align="center">
    This project aims to predict airline customer satisfaction using various machine learning models.
</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project analyzes factors contributing to airline customer satisfaction based on key attributes, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Flight-related features: Flight Distance, Departure/Arrival Delay Minutes</li>
    <li>Service features: Seat Comfort, Food and Drink, Inflight Entertainment, and Online Support</li>
    <li>Demographic features: Age, Gender, Customer Type, Type of Travel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies and Algorithms Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python: Data manipulation, visualization, and model training</li>
    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
    <li>Decision Tree Classifier</li>
    <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
    <li>Flask: Web application framework</li>
</ul>

<h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
<p>Each model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Random Forest performed best, balancing accuracy and interpretability.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The model helps identify key factors that influence customer satisfaction, guiding improvements in service quality. Using this approach, airlines can enhance customer experience and increase loyalty.</p>
